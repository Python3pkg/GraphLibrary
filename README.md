Graph library
This library contains options for working with graphs and directed graphs. You can manipulate graphs by adding and removing vertices and edges, check the successors and predecessors of directed graphs. Also it contains algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra algorithm, path searching algorithms, Prim algorithm for MST.
